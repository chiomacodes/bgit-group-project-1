# bgit-group-project-1
This is the group project of Chioma, Nina and Abi :)
- Group Profile 3 (Emily The Musician)
Chioma was responsible for creating and designing the About page. Chioma also created the repository and merged the other branches ready for marking.
Nina was responsible for creating and designing the Homepage and Contact form.
Abi was responsible for creating and designing the Portfolio page.

From the start of the assignment, all three developers had a synonymous idea of what type of musician we wanted Emily to represent. Research, resources and inspiration came primarily from Doja Cat and Dua Lipa's websites. Both websites have bold colours but their overall look was crisp and minimal. This was exciting and we were eager to replicate that vibe in our own way. 

Various questions were asked about what type of musician Emily is, where she is in her career, and therefore, how the website would serve her most efficiently. We put our heads together to think like the client and inference what they want this website to do for them. We were highly aware that as a front-facing professional, image is important and this will be their first port of call, after a business card that needs to sell them succinctly.

Chioma wanted her About page to humbly brag about her achievements whilst satisfying current fans and enticing new ones.

For Nina, the homepage had a desire to be clear, understated yet edgy, which was complimented well by the images and detailed fonts used. Midnight Blue and Magenta are the running themes of Emily's website, and it made sense to highlight the header and footer with the magenta as a way of allowing the main content to stand out.

When it came to the portfolio, Abi wanted to show that Emily was hard-working, successful and busy, therefore, showcasing several songs and albums gave the illusion of a fully-realised website, even though it had only been designed over a few weeks.

In conclusion, we firmly believe that Emily's career has been elevated by a website that boldly highlights who she is through colour, clean lines and music that begs to be heard!

Thank you for reading and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to let us know. Happy marking!
